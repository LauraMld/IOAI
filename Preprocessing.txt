1. Tokenization and Embedding Techniques

    SentencePiece: Use SentencePiece or Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) for subword tokenization, especially useful when dealing with languages that have morphological richness or are underrepresented.
    Character-level Embedding: For languages with complex scripts or those not supported well by mBERT, character-level embeddings can be helpful to capture morphological and orthographic nuances.

2. Data Augmentation

    Back-Translation: Use other languages supported by mBERT to translate the text and then back-translate it to the target language, increasing the diversity of your dataset.
    Synonym Replacement: Replace words with their synonyms using a thesaurus to create new training examples.
    Noise Injection: Introduce random noise such as shuffling or dropping words to make the model robust.

3. Transfer Learning and Self-Supervised Learning

    Self-Supervised Learning: Use the larger raw text corpus to pre-train mBERT on the target language in a self-supervised manner (e.g., Masked Language Modeling).
    Domain Adaptation: Fine-tune mBERT on a related language's dataset or use domain-specific data from the new language to adapt the model to the new language nuances.

4. Pseudo-Labeling

    Semi-Supervised Learning: Use the trained classifier to label the unlabeled data (raw corpus). Then, retrain the model using both the labeled and pseudo-labeled data to improve performance.

5. Data Preprocessing and Normalization

    Text Normalization: Normalize the text for consistent representation (e.g., removing diacritics, converting to lowercase).
    Text Cleaning: Remove noise such as HTML tags, special characters, and stop words if they do not contribute to the classification task.

6. Multilingual Embedding Alignment

    Cross-Lingual Alignment: Use techniques to align embeddings from multiple languages (supported by mBERT) to the target language. This can help leverage multilingual context effectively.

7. Ensemble Methods

    Ensemble Models: Train multiple models with different initialization seeds or architectures and combine their predictions to enhance robustness and performance.




Sentiment


1. Text Normalization

    Lowercasing: Convert all text to lowercase to ensure uniformity.
    Removing Accents and Diacritics: If applicable, remove accents and diacritics from characters to standardize text.
    Handling Special Characters and Punctuation: Remove or replace special characters and punctuation that do not contribute to sentiment.

2. Tokenization

    Word Tokenization: Split text into individual words using a suitable tokenizer. For an unknown language, you might need to develop a custom tokenizer.
    Subword Tokenization: Use subword tokenization methods like Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) or SentencePiece to handle out-of-vocabulary words effectively.

3. Stop Words Removal

    Stop Words Identification: Identify and remove common stop words in Language X if they do not contribute to sentiment.
    Custom Stop Words List: Create a custom list of stop words specific to Language X.

4. Lemmatization and Stemming

    Lemmatization: Reduce words to their base or root form. For example, "running" to "run."
    Stemming: Use stemming algorithms to strip suffixes from words. Choose between lemmatization and stemming based on the linguistic properties of Language X.

5. Handling Negations

    Negation Detection: Identify and appropriately handle negations in sentences, as they can significantly affect sentiment.
    Negation Tagging: Tag words following a negation word to capture the change in sentiment.

6. Handling Emoticons and Emojis

    Emoji Conversion: Convert emojis and emoticons into text equivalents as they often carry strong sentiment.
    Emoji Removal: Alternatively, remove emojis if they cannot be effectively converted.

7. Handling Repeated Characters

    Character Normalization: Normalize elongated words with repeated characters to their base form (e.g., "goooood" to "good").

8. Handling Slang and Abbreviations

    Slang Dictionary: Create a dictionary of common slang terms and abbreviations used in Language X and expand them to their full forms.

9. Data Augmentation

    Synonym Replacement: Replace words with their synonyms to create variations in the text.
    Back-Translation: Translate text to another language and back to Language X to create paraphrased versions.

10. Feature Engineering

    N-grams: Extract n-grams (bigrams, trigrams) to capture context that may affect sentiment.
    POS Tagging: Perform Part-of-Speech tagging to understand the grammatical structure and its effect on sentiment.
    TF-IDF: Calculate Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) to weigh the importance of words.

11. Vectorization

    Word Embeddings: Use pre-trained embeddings if available or train your own embeddings using Word2Vec, GloVe, or FastText.
    Subword Embeddings: Use subword embeddings to handle rare and out-of-vocabulary words effectively.

12. Handling Class Imbalance

    Oversampling: Duplicate examples from the minority class to balance the dataset.
    Undersampling: Remove examples from the majority class.
    Synthetic Data Generation: Use techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to generate synthetic examples for the minority class.
