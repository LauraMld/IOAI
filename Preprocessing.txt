1. Tokenization and Embedding Techniques

    SentencePiece: Use SentencePiece or Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) for subword tokenization, especially useful when dealing with languages that have morphological richness or are underrepresented.
    Character-level Embedding: For languages with complex scripts or those not supported well by mBERT, character-level embeddings can be helpful to capture morphological and orthographic nuances.

2. Data Augmentation

    Back-Translation: Use other languages supported by mBERT to translate the text and then back-translate it to the target language, increasing the diversity of your dataset.
    Synonym Replacement: Replace words with their synonyms using a thesaurus to create new training examples.
    Noise Injection: Introduce random noise such as shuffling or dropping words to make the model robust.

3. Transfer Learning and Self-Supervised Learning

    Self-Supervised Learning: Use the larger raw text corpus to pre-train mBERT on the target language in a self-supervised manner (e.g., Masked Language Modeling).
    Domain Adaptation: Fine-tune mBERT on a related language's dataset or use domain-specific data from the new language to adapt the model to the new language nuances.

4. Pseudo-Labeling

    Semi-Supervised Learning: Use the trained classifier to label the unlabeled data (raw corpus). Then, retrain the model using both the labeled and pseudo-labeled data to improve performance.

5. Data Preprocessing and Normalization

    Text Normalization: Normalize the text for consistent representation (e.g., removing diacritics, converting to lowercase).
    Text Cleaning: Remove noise such as HTML tags, special characters, and stop words if they do not contribute to the classification task.

6. Multilingual Embedding Alignment

    Cross-Lingual Alignment: Use techniques to align embeddings from multiple languages (supported by mBERT) to the target language. This can help leverage multilingual context effectively.

7. Ensemble Methods

    Ensemble Models: Train multiple models with different initialization seeds or architectures and combine their predictions to enhance robustness and performance.
