Transfer Learning

Transfer Learning involves leveraging knowledge gained from one task to improve performance on a related task. In the context of NLP and mBERT, transfer learning can be particularly effective for working with low-resource languages. Here's how you can apply it:
1. Pre-training on a Related Language

    Language Similarity: Identify a language supported by mBERT that is similar to your target language in terms of syntax, grammar, or script. For instance, if the target language is a dialect or closely related language, this can be very effective.
    Fine-Tuning: Fine-tune mBERT on the corpus of this related language to capture language-specific patterns and features. This adapted model can then be further fine-tuned on your target language dataset.

2. Domain Adaptation

    Domain-Specific Data: If you have access to domain-specific data in the target language or a related language, use this data to fine-tune mBERT. For example, if your classification task is in the medical domain, use medical texts.
    Intermediate Task Training: Perform intermediate training on a task similar to your final classification task but in a higher-resource language. This can help the model learn relevant features before fine-tuning on the target language dataset.

3. Cross-Lingual Training

    Multilingual Datasets: Use multilingual datasets that include the target language or closely related languages. Fine-tuning mBERT on these datasets can help it learn cross-lingual representations that are useful for the target language.
    Translation-Based Approaches: Translate the target language data into a high-resource language, fine-tune mBERT on this translated data, and then fine-tune again on the original target language data.

Self-Supervised Learning

Self-Supervised Learning involves training models on a task where the data itself provides the supervision. This approach is powerful when dealing with large amounts of unlabeled data. Here’s how you can use self-supervised learning:
1. Masked Language Modeling (MLM)

    Pre-Training on Raw Text: Use the raw text corpus provided by Amoira to pre-train mBERT on a masked language modeling task. This involves masking random tokens in the input text and training the model to predict these masked tokens. This helps the model learn the structure and vocabulary of the new language.

2. Denoising Autoencoders

    Noise Injection: Create corrupted versions of your raw text by introducing noise (e.g., random deletions, shuffling, masking). Train mBERT to reconstruct the original text from these corrupted versions. This can improve the model’s robustness to variations in the text.

3. Contrastive Learning

    Positive and Negative Pairs: Create positive pairs (e.g., sentences from the same document) and negative pairs (e.g., sentences from different documents) from your raw corpus. Train mBERT to distinguish between these pairs, learning to capture semantic similarities and differences.

Workflow Integration

Here’s how you can integrate Transfer Learning and Self-Supervised Learning into your workflow:

    Raw Text Preprocessing:
        Normalize and clean the raw text corpus.
        Tokenize the text using a suitable tokenizer like SentencePiece.

    Self-Supervised Pre-Training:
        Use the raw text corpus to pre-train mBERT on the MLM task.
        Optionally, use denoising autoencoders or contrastive learning to further enhance pre-training.

    Transfer Learning:
        Identify a related high-resource language or domain-specific corpus.
        Fine-tune mBERT on this related dataset to adapt it to the target language characteristics.
        Optionally, use cross-lingual datasets or translated data to improve mBERT’s cross-lingual understanding.

    Labeled Data Fine-Tuning:
        Use the augmented labeled dataset (created via data augmentation techniques) to fine-tune the pre-trained and adapted mBERT model.

    Pseudo-Labeling and Refinement:
        Apply the fine-tuned model to the raw text corpus to generate pseudo-labels.
        Retrain the model using both the original labeled data and the pseudo-labeled data.

    Optimization:
        Perform model pruning and quantization to ensure the model meets the inference time constraints.

Example:

    Pre-training: Use the raw text corpus to pre-train mBERT on MLM for the target language.
    Related Language Fine-Tuning: Fine-tune mBERT on a related language's dataset.
    Domain-Specific Adaptation: Further fine-tune on domain-specific texts if available.
    Data Augmentation: Apply data augmentation techniques to expand the labeled dataset.
    Final Fine-Tuning: Fine-tune mBERT on the augmented labeled dataset.
    Pseudo-Labeling: Generate pseudo-labels for the raw corpus and retrain the model.
    Optimization: Apply pruning and quantization for efficient inference.
